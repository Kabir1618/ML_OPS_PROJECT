# MLOps Project – Jenkins & GCP Deployment 🚀

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a complete **MLOps pipeline** using:
- **Jenkins** for CI/CD automation  
- **Docker** for containerization  
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** for deployment and scalability  

The pipeline automates the process of:
1. **Fetching source code** from GitHub  
2. **Creating and managing virtual environments**  
3. **Installing dependencies**  
4. **Training and testing the ML model**  
5. **Packaging with Docker**  
6. **Deploying to GCP** (Cloud Run / Compute Engine / Kubernetes, depending on setup)

## 🏗️ Pipeline Architecture
```

GitHub Repo → Jenkins Pipeline → Docker Image → GCP Deployment

````

- **Source Control**: GitHub  
- **CI/CD Orchestration**: Jenkins (running in a Dockerized environment with Docker-in-Docker support)  
- **Artifact Registry**: Docker Hub / GCP Artifact Registry  
- **Deployment Target**: GCP (Cloud Run / VM / GKE)  

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites
- Git & GitHub account  
- Docker installed locally  
- Jenkins (with required plugins: Pipeline, Git, Docker)  
- Google Cloud SDK installed and authenticated (`gcloud auth login`)  
- GCP project with billing enabled  

---

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ML_OPS_PROJECT.git
cd ML_OPS_PROJECT
````

### 2. Jenkins Setup

* Run Jenkins with Docker-in-Docker:

  ```bash
  docker run -d --name jenkins-dind \
    --privileged \
    -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 \
    -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home \
    jenkins-dind
  ```

* Install Jenkins plugins:

  * **Pipeline**
  * **Git**
  * **Docker Pipeline**
  * **GCP-related plugins (optional)**

* Configure Jenkins credentials:

  * **GitHub token** for repository access
  * **GCP Service Account key** for deployment

### 3. Jenkinsfile Pipeline

The pipeline includes:

* **Clone stage** → fetch repo from GitHub
* **Build stage** → setup Python venv & install dependencies
* **Test stage** → run model tests
* **Docker stage** → build & tag Docker image
* **Push stage** → push image to Docker Hub / GCP Artifact Registry
* **Deploy stage** → deploy image to GCP service

### 4. Deploy to GCP

Depending on your target:

* **Cloud Run**:

  ```bash
  gcloud run deploy mlops-service \
    --image gcr.io/<project-id>/mlops-image \
    --platform managed --region <region> --allow-unauthenticated
  ```
* **Compute Engine**: Deploy Docker container to VM
* **GKE**: Apply Kubernetes manifests

## 🧪 Example ML Workflow

1. Jenkins pulls the latest code from GitHub
2. Virtual environment is created & dependencies installed
3. Unit tests validate the pipeline
4. Model is trained & serialized (artifact)
5. Docker image is built and pushed to registry
6. GCP service pulls image and deploys model

---

## 📊 CI/CD Pipeline Stages

* **Stage 1**: Code Checkout
* **Stage 2**: Environment Setup
* **Stage 3**: Testing & Linting
* **Stage 4**: Model Training & Packaging
* **Stage 5**: Docker Build & Push
* **Stage 6**: Deployment to GCP

---

## 🔑 Credentials & Secrets

* Store secrets (tokens, keys) in Jenkins Credentials Manager
* Never commit sensitive files (like `key.json`) into GitHub

✨ With this setup, your ML pipeline is fully automated: **push code → Jenkins builds → Docker packages → GCP deploys**.
